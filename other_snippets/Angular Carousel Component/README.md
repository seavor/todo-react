# Carousel Component

## Service Description
- This component is a unit-tested responsive carousel. It's fairly straightforward, it takes a list of 9 books, sorts them into 3 slides, and inserts those slides into a carousel. It utilizes UI-Bootstrap's angular carousel component.
- The component also houses a data display element, which can switch to view data from other classes, requiring an API endpoint to fetch data, and a handler to load that data into the component.
